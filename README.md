# Why  

There exists a track that etched my teenage years in the 1990's - well, the calm bits.  
  
It is kinda synthwave, sorta acid jazz, mostly trance - I guess.

I owned a CD this was on, and possibly the record EP, but when I left Adelaide in late 90's I gave my collection away.  
  
Here is the album it was on:
